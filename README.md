# streamz3

create functions in analysis_functions1.py

Add the analysis pipelines in the 'add_data' function in the analysis_framework file

Then seeing the setting_up file to see how to send data to the functions, remember to include an id for the different sensors. New separate pipelines will be created for every new data data stream coming in - filter them by sensor id.
